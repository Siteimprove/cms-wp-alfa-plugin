Catch, monitor, and resolve web accessibility issues in minutes—right from your WordPress CMS.

== Description ==

The Siteimprove Accessibility plugin allows you to catch, monitor, and resolve accessibility issues in minutes—right from your WordPress CMS. Go beyond an overlay solution – ensure your site meets ADA and WCAG 2.2 standards through automated scanning, AI-powered suggestions, and developer tools before content goes live.

== Installation ==

There are a few ways to install the Siteimprove Accessibility plugin on WordPress.

- To install the plugin via the plugin listing page, type ‘Siteimprove Accessibility’ in the search box on the WordPress plugin listing page and click on ‘install’, or
- You can upload the Siteimprove Accessibility plugin zip file using WordPress’ ‘Upload Plugin’ feature, or
- You can upload the unzipped 'siteimprove-accessibility' folder into to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory on your website via FTP.

The plugin can be activated via your Plugins page immediately after installation.


= Configuration =

You can manage certain features of the plugin, by clicking on the "Settings" link in the plugin list, under the name of this plugin.

A new Siteimprove Accessibility navigation item will also appear on the left menu bar, where you can also find the Settings page amongst other functionality. Click on this navigation item to continue configuring the plugin.

Note, that plugin configuration is only available for users who can manage plugins (usually administrators).


= Usage =

After installing and activating the plugin, you can start testing pages by navigating to them (i.e. your site's homepage, posts, pages, etc.) and clicking on the floating Siteimprove Accessibility overlay on the top-right side (or according to the configured position) of the page.

When the overlay is triggered, a new accessibility check will be executed on that page, and you will see the issues found directly.

You can also review the accessibility issues on the posts and pages you are currently editing in the Gutenberg block editor, if a check was already executed on that piece of content before.

While editing a post or a page, you can also evaluate the impact of your changes by checking the page in draft mode.

Additionally, you will be able to see the summary of known accessibility problems across your site under the Issues navigation item, and see a daily breakdown of the issues under Reports.
